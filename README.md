# Rubik's Cube Solver

## Description
This project is a work-in-progress Python implementation of a Rubik's Cube solver. It aims to provide a step-by-step solution for solving a scrambled Rubik's Cube using a series of algorithms.

## Features
- Cube representation and visualization
- Cube scrambling
- Solving algorithms for:
  - Daisy pattern
  - White cross
  - White face
  - Second layer
- (More features to be added as development progresses)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- colorama library

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rubiks-cube-solver.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install colorama
   ```

## Usage
Run the script:
```
python Rubik-s-Cube-Solver.py
```

The program will automatically scramble the cube and attempt to solve it.

## Current Status
This project is still under development. The following components are implemented:
- Cube representation and basic moves
- Cube scrambling
- Solving algorithms for the daisy pattern, white cross, white face, and second layer

Work is ongoing for:
- Yellow face solving algorithm
- Full cube solution
- Optimization of solving algorithms
- User interface improvements
